<u>The Rule Roundup</u><br>
Moderators of the forum (General, OC & Sales) are chosen only by those who are given the powers to do so. These will be strictly Moderators (in yellow) and Administrators (in orange). They have the responsibility to keep the forum clean and regular of its contents, aswell as removing any unsuitable topics which seem unnessecsary or innaporpriate for viewing. Moderators and Administrators reserve the right to remove the Forum Moderator status whenever suitable.
<br><br>
Help Assistance Operators (HDOP's); once again are sub-staff positions, only handed out by administrators and moderators. Their aim and sole objective is to present any unsure member of any appropriate action. Regular contributions to answering questions is asked of them whenever possible. They must be active and if they are not so, then their sub-staff poition shall be stripped, as mods and admins reserve the right to do this action at any time.
<br><br>
Moderators contain a higer userlevel than that of a sub-staff or non-staff members of Thug Paradise. Aspects of this game are given to each of them to control and maintain the correct usage of the game in general. Thug Paradise reserve the right for their moderators to ban the IP or modkill a user of which does the opposite of comply with these set regulations. They are picked on an unusual basis; whenever the administrators believe it is a right time to gain another member in addition to the moderators already. Administrators have the right to remove moderation status at any time within agreement with each other.
<br><br>
The Administrators of the game are the head of all staff. They will persist throughout the game, making sure everything is running smoothly; including the server, game credinitials and many more. They shall confer with each other on a daily basis commenting on staff positions, as well as game prosperities.
<br><br><br>
<b>As a member of Thug Paradise, you must not:</b><br>
<li>Give the accesibility of the account to anyone whom may desire it. Faliure to understand this and enhance it will result in an immediate modkill.
<li>Attempt to hack an account that is in ownership of someone else: yet again, this shall also result in an almost immediate modkill upon the capture.
<li>Use programmes / special additions that enable the automatic accomplishment of any in game action which may or may not convey the adding of objects towards yours or anyone else's account. This, like all other rule breakings shall result in an instant modkill.
<li>Be the rightful owner of more than one account which is alive and playable in the game at any given time. Failure to comply with this rule will result in modkill.
<li>Develop or take advantage of a bug or glitch within the game which dramatically changes the course and action of the game. Resulting in modkill.
<li>Sell any of the accounts of which you have created purposefully on this game and sell them for in-game/out-game cash and visa versa. You will be the recipient of a modkill if you do not comply. Out of game cash or credinitials can not be affected, however the account shall be termited.
<li>Deliberately spam any feature of this game about any other games, or even in-chat conversation. Although both are expreme, the advertising shall result in an instant modkill and IP ban whilst you could face prosecution along with the website/object/company of which you are advertising for. 
<br><br>
<b>Please also remember:</b>

<lI>Users must only access their own account, and if any interactions or other transactions are made between any account on the same internet protocol, will be subject to haveing their account(s) modkilled or IP banned.

<li>Responisiblility of your password if you sign up to this game is totally your responsibility. We shall not be liable for the infiltration of your account by any means, but we shall also modkill the person who hacked your account if necessary. The refundability of any items that you may have been holding on that account can not be returned, as it is your choice to have a weak password. The investigation into your account's hacking will be inevitable as we want the game to be free of any cheats.
<li>Accounts which have been banned or killed in any way shall lose all of the rights of which they had upon signing up, as they have obviously not farmiliarised themselves with the TOS and shall only be let back onto this online game if the administators feel necessary. <br><br>
Thug Paradise is not liable for any loses from your account whilst cheating.
Upon your death on this game, users do not have the rights to transfer any items from one IP to the other unless this item is credits as real money has been used to buy these and it would be unfair to confiscate them. Cheats will not, however be allowed to transfer their credits from account to account, as this will lead to the unbalancing of the game.<br><br>
If the accesibility of Thug Paradise is not possible, refrain from using a proxy as this is an illegal move on this game. If you are caught using one, you shall be instantainiously modkilled without warning. Please bare in mind proxy's have recognisable IP's!
<br><br><br>
<u>Acceptance of Terms</u><br>
TP is the abbreviated name for the popular online game Thug Paradise of which offers a free service which you are subject to following the TOS at all times, although the text of which you are reading is subject to change at any given time.

<u>Description of Services Offered</u><br>

Whilst this game is an online game, it goes under the name of a text based game also known as an MMRPG (massive multiplayer roll-play game). Having fun is enabled through the interaction and the activities offered to you by administrators at their own choosing. By signing up, you take into account that the need for advertising may sometimes be required for services to be resumed and accomplised simultaniously. Communication plays a key role in the creation and withstanding of this game and is sometimes accepted when realised to be required in urgent situations. If you feel the need to be removed from these operations, when you are signing up, you must devote yourself to being lenient.<br><br>

<u>Image Intention</u><br>

Any images made in intent to be used on Thug Paradise are there by legal to be used on thug-paradise.co.uk or thug-paradise.com.

Features, new and old will not be held responsible for consumation of any time lost or moderations to yours/anyone elses account, as the original setting are difficult to reset to previous chronology. Again, your responsible for actions past, present and in some cases future.<br><br>
